Goal:
******
In our BI project we would like to compare the amount of cyclists in Berlin on a specific place over different days in the week, months or years. The increase, decrease and changes over time can be distinguished. This can be an indicator to see where an infrastructure needs to be improved to make cycling experience more safe and comfortable which in turn can encourage more Berlin residents to start cycling to promote sustainable mobility. In addition we are merging Berlin weather data set together with Berlin cycling data set to analyse trends and patterns of cyclists in Berlin depending on weather. We will establish the different variables that influence Berlin cyclists patterns.
